# Ubuntu 22.04 Meta STIG Rules

## V-260469

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must disable the x86 Ctrl-Alt-Delete key sequence.

### Description
A locally logged-on user who presses Ctrl-Alt-Delete, when at the console, can reboot the system. If accidentally pressed, as could happen in the case of a mixed OS environment, this can create the risk of short-term loss of availability of systems due to unintentional reboot.

### Rule Check
Verify Ubuntu 22.04 LTS is not configured to reboot the system when Ctrl-Alt-Delete is pressed by using the following command: 
 
     $ systemctl status ctrl-alt-del.target 
     ctrl-alt-del.target 
          Loaded: masked (Reason: Unit ctrl-alt-del.target is masked.) 
          Active: inactive (dead) 
 
If the "ctrl-alt-del.target" is not masked, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to disable the Ctrl-Alt-Delete sequence for the command line by using the following commands: 
 
     $ sudo systemctl disable ctrl-alt-del.target 
 
     $ sudo systemctl mask ctrl-alt-del.target 
 
Reload the daemon to take effect:  
 
     $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload

## V-260470

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, when booted, must require authentication upon booting into single-user and maintenance modes.

### Description
To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by DOD-approved PKIs, all DOD systems (e.g., web servers and web portals) must be properly configured to incorporate access control methods that do not rely solely on the possession of a certificate for access.   
  
Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement.  
  
Access control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system.

### Rule Check
Verify Ubuntu 22.04 LTS requires a password for authentication upon booting into single-user and maintenance modes by using the following command:  
  
     $ sudo grep -i password /boot/grub/grub.cfg  
  
     password_pbkdf2 root grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.03255F190F0E2F7B4F0D1C3216012309162F022A7A636771 
  
If the root password entry does not begin with "password_pbkdf2", this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to require a password for authentication upon booting into single-user and maintenance modes.  
  
Generate an encrypted (grub) password for root by using the following command:  
  
     $ grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2  
     Enter Password:  
     Reenter Password: 
     PBKDF2 hash of your password is grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.03255F190F0E2F7B4F0D1C3216012309162F022A7A636771 
  
Using the hash from the output, modify the "/etc/grub.d/40_custom" file by using the following command to add a boot password:  
  
     $ sudo sed -i '$i set superusers=\"root\"\npassword_pbkdf2 root <hash>' /etc/grub.d/40_custom  
  
where <hash> is the hash generated by grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2 command.  
  
Generate an updated "grub.conf" file with the new password by using the following command:  
  
     $ sudo update-grub

## V-260471

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must initiate session audits at system startup.

### Description
If auditing is enabled late in the startup process, the actions of some startup processes may not be audited. Some audit systems also maintain state information only available if auditing is enabled before a given process is created.

### Rule Check
Verify that Ubuntu 22.04 LTS enables auditing at system startup in grub by using the following command:
  
     $ grep "^\s*linux" /boot/grub/grub.cfg 
 
     linux   /vmlinuz-5.15.0-89-generic root=/dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv ro audit=1 
          linux   /vmlinuz-5.15.0-89-generic root=/dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv ro audit=1 
          linux   /vmlinuz-5.15.0-89-generic root=/dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv ro single nomodeset dis_ucode_ldr audit=1 
          linux   /vmlinuz-5.15.0-83-generic root=/dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv ro audit=1 
          linux   /vmlinuz-5.15.0-83-generic root=/dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv ro single nomodeset dis_ucode_ldr audit=1 
 
If any linux lines do not contain "audit=1", this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to produce audit records at system startup.   
  
Edit the "/etc/default/grub" file and add "audit=1" to the "GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX" option.  
  
To update the grub config file, run:  
  
     $ sudo update-grub

## V-260472

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must restrict access to the kernel message buffer.

### Description
Restricting access to the kernel message buffer limits access only to root. This prevents attackers from gaining additional system information as a nonprivileged user.

### Rule Check
Verify Ubuntu 22.04 LTS is configured to restrict access to the kernel message buffer by using the following command: 
 
     $ sysctl kernel.dmesg_restrict 
     kernel.dmesg_restrict = 1 
 
If "kernel.dmesg_restrict" is not set to "1" or is missing, this is a finding. 
 
Verify that there are no configurations that enable the kernel dmesg function: 
 
     $ sudo grep -ir kernel.dmesg_restrict /run/sysctl.d/* /etc/sysctl.d/* /usr/local/lib/sysctl.d/* /usr/lib/sysctl.d/* /lib/sysctl.d/* /etc/sysctl.conf 2> /dev/null 
     /etc/sysctl.d/10-kernel-hardening.conf:kernel.dmesg_restrict = 1 
 
If "kernel.dmesg_restrict" is not set to "1", is commented out, is missing, or conflicting results are returned, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to restrict access to the kernel message buffer. 
 
Add or modify the following line in the "/etc/sysctl.conf" file: 
 
kernel.dmesg_restrict = 1 
 
Remove any configurations that conflict with the above from the following locations:  
 
/run/sysctl.d/ 
/etc/sysctl.d/ 
/usr/local/lib/sysctl.d/ 
/usr/lib/sysctl.d/ 
/lib/sysctl.d/ 
/etc/sysctl.conf 
 
Reload settings from all system configuration files by using the following command: 
 
     $ sudo sysctl --system

---

## V-260473

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must disable kernel core dumps so that it can fail to a secure state if system initialization fails, shutdown fails or aborts fail.

### Description
Kernel core dumps may contain the full contents of system memory at the time of the crash. Kernel core dumps may consume a considerable amount of disk space and may result in denial of service by exhausting the available space on the target file system partition.

### Rule Check
Verify that kernel core dumps are disabled unless needed by using the following command:  
  
     $ systemctl status kdump.service 
     kdump.service 
          Loaded: masked (Reason: Unit kdump.service is masked.) 
          Active: inactive (dead) 
  
If "kdump.service" is not masked and inactive, ask the system administrator (SA) if the use of the service is required and documented with the information system security officer (ISSO).  
  
If the service is active and is not documented, this is a finding.

### Fix
If kernel core dumps are not required, disable and mask "kdump.service" by using the following command:  
 
     $ sudo systemctl mask kdump --now 
  
If kernel core dumps are required, document the need with the ISSO.

## V-260474

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must implement address space layout randomization to protect its memory from unauthorized code execution.

### Description
Some adversaries launch attacks with the intent of executing code in nonexecutable regions of memory or in prohibited memory locations. Security safeguards employed to protect memory include, for example, data execution prevention and address space layout randomization. Data execution prevention safeguards can either be hardware-enforced or software-enforced with hardware providing the greater strength of mechanism.  
  
Examples of attacks are buffer overflow attacks.

### Rule Check
Verify Ubuntu 22.04 LTS implements address space layout randomization (ASLR) by using the following command:  
  
     $ sysctl kernel.randomize_va_space 
     kernel.randomize_va_space = 2 
  
If no output is returned, verify the kernel parameter "randomize_va_space" is set to "2" by using the following command:  
  
     $ cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space 
     2 
  
If "kernel.randomize_va_space" is not set to "2", this is a finding.  
  
Verify that a saved value of the "kernel.randomize_va_space" variable is not defined.  
  
     $ sudo grep -ER "^kernel.randomize_va_space=[^2]" /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d 
  
If this returns a result, this is a finding.

### Fix
Remove the "kernel.randomize_va_space" entry found in the "/etc/sysctl.conf" file or any file located in the "/etc/sysctl.d/" directory.  
 
Reload the system configuration files for the changes to take effect by using the following command: 
 
     $ sudo sysctl --system

---

## V-260475

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must implement nonexecutable data to protect its memory from unauthorized code execution.

### Description
Some adversaries launch attacks with the intent of executing code in nonexecutable regions of memory or in memory locations that are prohibited. Security safeguards employed to protect memory include, for example, data execution prevention and address space layout randomization. Data execution prevention safeguards can either be hardware-enforced or software-enforced with hardware providing the greater strength of mechanism.  
  
Examples of attacks are buffer overflow attacks.

### Rule Check
Verify the NX (no-execution) bit flag is set on the system by using the following command:  
 
     $ sudo dmesg | grep -i "execute disable" 
     [    0.000000] NX (Execute Disable) protection: active  
 
If "dmesg" does not show "NX (Execute Disable) protection: active", check the hardware capabilities of the installed CPU by using the following command:   
  
     $ grep flags /proc/cpuinfo | grep -o nx | sort -u 
     nx  
  
If no output is returned, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to enable NX.  
  
If the installed CPU is hardware capable of NX protection, check if the system's BIOS/UEFI setup configuration permits toggling the "NX bit" or "no execution bit", and set it to "enabled".

## V-260476

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must be configured so that the Advance Package Tool (APT) prevents the installation of patches, service packs, device drivers, or operating system components without verification they have been digitally signed using a certificate that is recognized and approved by the organization.

### Description
Changes to any software components can have significant effects on the overall security of the operating system. This requirement ensures the software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by a trusted vendor.
  
Accordingly, patches, service packs, device drivers, or operating system components must be signed with a certificate recognized and approved by the organization.
  
Verifying the authenticity of the software prior to installation validates the integrity of the patch or upgrade received from a vendor. This ensures the software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by a trusted vendor. Self-signed certificates are disallowed by this requirement. The operating system should not have to verify the software again. This requirement does not mandate DOD certificates for this purpose; however, the certificate used to verify the software must be from an approved certificate authority (CA).

### Rule Check
Verify that APT is configured to prevent the installation of patches, service packs, device drivers, or Ubuntu operating system components without verification they have been digitally signed using a certificate that is recognized and approved by the organization by using the following command:  
  
     $ grep -i allowunauthenticated /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/* 
     /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01-vendor-ubuntu:APT::Get::AllowUnauthenticated "false"; 
  
If "APT::Get::AllowUnauthenticated" is not set to "false", is commented out, or is missing, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure APT to prevent the installation of patches, service packs, device drivers, or Ubuntu operating system components without verification they have been digitally signed using a certificate that is recognized and approved by the organization.  
  
Add or modify the following line in any file under the "/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/" directory: 
 
APT::Get::AllowUnauthenticated "false";

---

## V-260477

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must be configured so that the Advance Package Tool (APT) removes all software components after updated versions have been installed.

### Description
Previous versions of software components that are not removed from the information system after updates have been installed may be exploited by adversaries. Some information technology products may remove older versions of software automatically from the information system.

### Rule Check
Verify APT is configured to remove all software components after updated versions have been installed by using the following command:  
  
     $ grep -i remove-unused /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50-unattended-upgrades 
     Unattended-Upgrade::Remove-Unused-Kernel-Packages "true"; 
     Unattended-Upgrade::Remove-Unused-Dependencies "true"; 
  
If "Unattended-Upgrade::Remove-Unused-Kernel-Packages" and "Unattended-Upgrade::Remove-Unused-Dependencies" are not set to "true", are commented out, or are missing, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure APT to remove all software components after updated versions have been installed.  
  
Add or modify the following lines in the "/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50-unattended-upgrades" file:  
 
Unattended-Upgrade::Remove-Unused-Kernel-Packages "true"; 
Unattended-Upgrade::Remove-Unused-Dependencies "true";

## V-260478

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must have the "libpam-pwquality" package installed.

### Description
Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks. "pwquality" enforces complex password construction configuration and has the ability to limit brute-force attacks on the system.

### Rule Check
Verify Ubuntu 22.04 LTS has the "libpam-pwquality" package installed with  the following command:  
  
     $ dpkg -l | grep libpam-pwquality 
     ii     libpam-pwquality:amd64     1.4.4-1build2     amd64     PAM module to check password strength 
  
If "libpam-pwquality" is not installed, this is a finding.

### Fix
Install the "pam_pwquality" package by using the following command: 
  
     $ sudo apt-get install libpam-pwquality

---

## V-260479

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must have the "chrony" package installed.

### Description
Inaccurate time stamps make it more difficult to correlate events and can lead to an inaccurate analysis. Determining the correct time a particular event occurred on a system is critical when conducting forensic analysis and investigating system events. Sources outside the configured acceptable allowance (drift) may be inaccurate.  

Organizations must consider endpoints that may not have regular access to the authoritative time server (e.g., mobile, teleworking, and tactical endpoints).

### Rule Check
Verify the "chrony" package is installed using the following command: 
  
     $ dpkg -l | grep chrony 
     ii     chrony     4.2-2ubuntu2     amd64     Versatile implementation of the Network Time Protocol 
 
If the "chrony" package is not installed, this is a finding.

### Fix
Install the "chrony" network time protocol package using the following command: 
 
     $ sudo apt-get install chrony

---

## V-260480

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must not have the "systemd-timesyncd" package installed.

### Description
Inaccurate time stamps make it more difficult to correlate events and can lead to an inaccurate analysis. Determining the correct time a particular event occurred on a system is critical when conducting forensic analysis and investigating system events. Sources outside the configured acceptable allowance (drift) may be inaccurate.

Organizations must consider endpoints that may not have regular access to the authoritative time server (e.g., mobile, teleworking, and tactical endpoints).

### Rule Check
Verify that the "systemd-timesyncd" package is not installed by using the following command: 
 
     $ dpkg -l | grep systemd-timesyncd 
 
If the "systemd-timesyncd" package is installed, this is a finding.

### Fix
The "systemd-timesyncd" package will be uninstalled as part of the "chrony" package install. The remaining configuration files for "systemd-timesyncd" must be purged from the operating system: 
 
     $ sudo dpkg -P --force-all systemd-timesyncd

---

## V-260481

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must not have the "ntp" package installed.

### Description
Inaccurate time stamps make it more difficult to correlate events and can lead to an inaccurate analysis. Determining the correct time a particular event occurred on a system is critical when conducting forensic analysis and investigating system events. Sources outside the configured acceptable allowance (drift) may be inaccurate.  

Organizations must consider endpoints that may not have regular access to the authoritative time server (e.g., mobile, teleworking, and tactical endpoints).

### Rule Check

     $ dpkg -l | grep ntp 
 
If the "ntp" package is installed, this is a finding.

### Fix
Uninstall the "ntp" package by using the following command: 
 
     $ sudo dpkg -P --force-all ntp

---

## V-260482

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must not have the "rsh-server" package installed.

### Description
It is detrimental for operating systems to provide, or install by default, functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives. These unnecessary capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore may remain unsecured. They increase the risk to the platform by providing additional attack vectors.  
  
Remote Shell (RSH) is a client/server application protocol that provides an unencrypted remote access service, which does not provide for the confidentiality and integrity of user passwords or the remote session. If users were allowed to login to a system using RSH, the privileged user passwords and communications could be compromised. 
 
Removing the "rsh-server" package decreases the risk of accidental or intentional activation of the RSH service.

### Rule Check
Verify the "rsh-server" package is not installed by using the following command:  
  
     $ dpkg -l | grep rsh-server 
  
If the "rsh-server" package is installed, this is a finding.

### Fix
Remove the "rsh-server" package by using the following command:  
 
     $ sudo apt-get remove rsh-server

---

## V-260483

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must not have the "telnet" package installed.

### Description
It is detrimental for operating systems to provide, or install by default, functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives. These unnecessary capabilities are often overlooked and therefore, may remain unsecure. They increase the risk to the platform by providing additional attack vectors. 
 
Telnet is a client/server application protocol that provides an unencrypted remote access service, which does not provide for the confidentiality and integrity of user passwords or the remote session. If users were allowed to login to a system using Telnet, the privileged user passwords and communications could be compromised. 
 
Removing the "telnetd" package decreases the risk of accidental or intentional activation of the Telnet service.

### Rule Check
Verify that the "telnetd" package is not installed on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS by using the following command:  
 
     $ dpkg -l | grep telnetd 
 
If the "telnetd" package is installed, this is a finding.

### Fix
Remove the "telnetd" package by using the following command:  
  
     $ sudo apt-get remove telnetd

---

## V-260484

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of all information that requires protection at rest.

### Description
Operating systems handling data requiring "data at rest" protections must employ cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of the information at rest.  
  
Selection of a cryptographic mechanism is based on the need to protect the integrity of organizational information. The strength of the mechanism is commensurate with the security category and/or classification of the information. Organizations have the flexibility to either encrypt all information on storage devices (i.e., full disk encryption) or encrypt specific data structures (e.g., files, records, or fields).

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000185-GPOS-00079, SRG-OS-000404-GPOS-00183, SRG-OS-000405-GPOS-00184

### Rule Check
Verify Ubuntu 22.04 LTS prevents unauthorized disclosure or modification of all information requiring at-rest protection by using disk encryption.   
 
Note: If there is a documented and approved reason for not having data-at-rest encryption, this requirement is not applicable. 
  
Determine the partition layout for the system by using the following command:  
  
     $ sudo fdisk -l 
 
     ... 
     Device               Start               End        Sectors       Size  Type 
     /dev/sda1         2048      2203647       2201600          1G  EFI System 
     /dev/sda2  2203648      6397951       4194304          2G  Linux filesystem 
     /dev/sda3  6397952  536868863  530470912  252.9G  Linux filesystem 
     ... 
  
Verify the system partitions are all encrypted by using the following command:  
 
     # more /etc/crypttab 
 
Every persistent disk partition present must have an entry in the file.   
  
If any partitions other than the boot partition or pseudo file systems (such as /proc or /sys) are not listed, this is a finding.

### Fix
To encrypt an entire partition, dedicate a partition for encryption in the partition layout.  
  
Note: Encrypting a partition in an already-installed system is more difficult because it will need to be resized and existing partitions changed.

## V-260485

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must have directories that contain system commands set to a mode of "755" or less permissive.

### Description
Protecting audit information also includes identifying and protecting the tools used to view and manipulate log data. Therefore, protecting audit tools is necessary to prevent unauthorized operation on audit information.  
  
Operating systems providing tools to interface with audit information will leverage user permissions and roles identifying the user accessing the tools and the corresponding rights the user has in order to make access decisions regarding the deletion of audit tools.  
  
Audit tools include, but are not limited to, vendor-provided and open source audit tools needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information system activity and records. Audit tools include custom queries and report generators.

### Rule Check
Verify the system commands directories have mode "755" or less permissive by using the following command:  
  
     $ find /bin /sbin /usr/bin /usr/sbin /usr/local/bin /usr/local/sbin -perm /022 -type d -exec stat -c "%n %a" '{}' \;  
  
If any directories are found to be group-writable or world-writable, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure Ubuntu 22.04 LTS commands directories to be protected from unauthorized access. Run the following command:  
  
     $ sudo find /bin /sbin /usr/bin /usr/sbin /usr/local/bin /usr/local/sbin -perm /022 -type d -exec chmod -R 755 '{}' \;

---

## V-260486

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must have system commands set to a mode of "755" or less permissive.

### Description
If Ubuntu 22.04 LTS were to allow any user to make changes to software libraries, then those changes might be implemented without undergoing the appropriate testing and approvals that are part of a robust change management process.  
  
This requirement applies to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS with software libraries that are accessible and configurable, as in the case of interpreted languages. Software libraries also include privileged programs that execute with escalated privileges. Only qualified and authorized individuals must be allowed to obtain access to information system components for purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications.

### Rule Check
Verify the system commands contained in the following directories have mode "755" or less permissive by using the following command:  
  
     $ sudo find /bin /sbin /usr/bin /usr/sbin /usr/local/bin /usr/local/sbin -perm /022 -type f -exec stat -c "%n %a" '{}' \; 
  
If any files are found to be group-writable or world-writable, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure Ubuntu 22.04 LTS commands to be protected from unauthorized access. Run the following command:  
  
     $ sudo find /bin /sbin /usr/bin /usr/sbin /usr/local/bin /usr/local/sbin -perm /022 -type f -exec chmod 755 '{}' \;

---

## V-260487

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS library files must have mode "755" or less permissive.

### Description
If the operating system were to allow any user to make changes to software libraries, then those changes might be implemented without undergoing the appropriate testing and approvals that are part of a robust change management process.  
  
This requirement applies to operating systems with software libraries that are accessible and configurable, as in the case of interpreted languages. Software libraries also include privileged programs that execute with escalated privileges. Only qualified and authorized individuals must be allowed to obtain access to information system components for purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications.

### Rule Check
Verify the systemwide shared library files contained in the directories "/lib", "/lib64", and "/usr/lib" have mode "755" or less permissive by using the following command:  
  
     $ sudo find /lib /lib64 /usr/lib -perm /022 -type f -exec stat -c "%n %a" '{}' \; 
 
If any files are found to be group-writable or world-writable, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure the library files to be protected from unauthorized access. Run the following command:  
 
     $ sudo find /lib /lib64 /usr/lib -perm /022 -type f -exec chmod 755 '{}' \;

---

## V-260488

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must configure the "/var/log" directory to have mode "755" or less permissive.

### Description
Only authorized personnel should be aware of errors and the details of the errors. Error messages are an indicator of an organization's operational state or can identify the operating system or platform. Additionally, personally identifiable information (PII) and operational information must not be revealed through error messages to unauthorized personnel or their designated representatives.  
  
The structure and content of error messages must be carefully considered by the organization and development team. The extent to which the information system is able to identify and handle error conditions is guided by organizational policy and operational requirements.

### Rule Check
Verify the "/var/log" directory has mode of "755" or less permissive by using the following command: 
 
Note: If rsyslog is active and enabled on the operating system, this requirement is not applicable. 
 
     $ stat -c "%n %a" /var/log 
     /var/log 755 
 
If a value of "755" or less permissive is not returned, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure the "/var/log" directory to have permissions of "0755" by using the following command:  
 
     $ sudo chmod 0755 /var/log

Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must generate error messages that provide information necessary for corrective actions without revealing information that could be exploited by adversaries.

### Description
Any operating system providing too much information in error messages risks compromising the data and security of the structure, and content of error messages needs to be carefully considered by the organization.  
  
Organizations carefully consider the structure/content of error messages. The extent to which information systems are able to identify and handle error conditions is guided by organizational policy and operational requirements. Information that could be exploited by adversaries includes, for example, erroneous logon attempts with passwords entered by mistake as the username, mission/business information that can be derived from (if not stated explicitly by) information recorded, and personal information, such as account numbers, social security numbers, and credit card numbers. 
 
The /var/log/btmp, /var/log/wtmp, and /var/log/lastlog files have group write and global read permissions to allow for the lastlog function to perform. Limiting the permissions beyond this configuration will result in the failure of functions that rely on the lastlog database.

### Rule Check
Verify Ubuntu 22.04 LTS has all system log files under the "/var/log" directory with a permission set to "640" or less permissive by using the following command: 
 
Note: The btmp, wtmp, and lastlog files are excluded. Refer to the Discussion for details. 
 
     $ sudo find /var/log -perm /137 ! -name '*[bw]tmp' ! -name '*lastlog' -type f -exec stat -c "%n %a" {} \; 
 
If the command displays any output, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to set permissions of all log files under the "/var/log" directory to "640" or more restricted by using the following command: 
 
Note: The btmp, wtmp, and lastlog files are excluded. Refer to the Discussion for details. 
 
     $ sudo find /var/log -perm /137 ! -name '*[bw]tmp' ! -name '*lastlog' -type f -exec chmod 640 '{}' \;

## V-260512

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must be configured so that the "journalctl" command is not accessible by unauthorized users.

### Description
Any operating system providing too much information in error messages risks compromising the data and security of the structure, and content of error messages needs to be carefully considered by the organization.  
  
Organizations carefully consider the structure/content of error messages. The extent to which information systems are able to identify and handle error conditions is guided by organizational policy and operational requirements. Information that could be exploited by adversaries includes, for example, erroneous logon attempts with passwords entered by mistake as the username, mission/business information that can be derived from (if not stated explicitly by) information recorded, and personal information, such as account numbers, social security numbers, and credit card numbers.

### Rule Check

## V-260513

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must set a sticky bit on all public directories to prevent unauthorized and unintended information transferred via shared system resources.

### Description
Preventing unauthorized information transfers mitigates the risk of information, including encrypted representations of information, produced by the actions of prior users/roles (or the actions of processes acting on behalf of prior users/roles) from being available to any current users/roles (or current processes) that obtain access to shared system resources (e.g., registers, main memory, hard disks) after those resources have been released back to information systems. The control of information in shared resources is also commonly referred to as object reuse and residual information protection.  
  
This requirement generally applies to the design of an information technology product, but it can also apply to the configuration of particular information system components that are, or use, such products. This can be verified by acceptance/validation processes in DOD or other government agencies.  
  
There may be shared resources with configurable protections (e.g., files in storage) that may be assessed on specific information system components.

### Rule Check
Verify that all public directories have the public sticky bit set by using the following command:   
  
     $ sudo find / -type d -perm -002 ! -perm -1000 
  
If any public directories are found missing the sticky bit, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure all public directories to have the sticky bit set to prevent unauthorized and unintended information transferred via shared system resources.  
  
Set the sticky bit on all public directories using the following command, replacing "<public_directory_name>" with any directory path missing the sticky bit:  
  
     $ sudo chmod +t  <public_directory_name>

## V-260514

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must have an application firewall installed in order to control remote access methods.

### Description
Remote access services, such as those providing remote access to network devices and information systems, which lack automated control capabilities, increase risk and make remote user access management difficult at best.  
  
Remote access is access to DOD nonpublic information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, nonorganization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.  
  
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS functionality (e.g., RDP) must be capable of taking enforcement action if the audit reveals unauthorized activity. Automated control of remote access sessions allows organizations to ensure ongoing compliance with remote access policies by enforcing connection rules of remote access applications on a variety of information system components (e.g., servers, workstations, notebook computers, smartphones, and tablets).

### Rule Check
Verify that the Uncomplicated Firewall is installed by using the following command:  
  
     $ dpkg -l | grep ufw 
     ii     ufw     0.36.1-4ubuntu0.1     all     program for managing a Netfilter firewall 
  
If the "ufw" package is not installed, ask the system administrator if another application firewall is installed.

## V-260517

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must configure the Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw) to rate-limit impacted network interfaces.

### Description
Denial of service (DoS) is a condition when a resource is not available for legitimate users. When this occurs, the organization either cannot accomplish its mission or must operate at degraded capacity.  
  
This requirement addresses the configuration of the operating system to mitigate the impact of DoS attacks that have occurred or are ongoing on system availability. For each system, known and potential DoS attacks must be identified and solutions for each type implemented. A variety of technologies exist to limit or, in some cases, eliminate the effects of DoS attacks (e.g., limiting processes or establishing memory partitions). Employing increased capacity and bandwidth, combined with service redundancy, may reduce the susceptibility to some DoS attacks.

### Rule Check
Verify an application firewall is configured to rate limit any connection to the system.  
  
Check all the services listening to the ports by using the following command:  
  
     $ ss -l46ut 
     Netid               State          Recv-Q          Send-Q                               Local Address:Port            Peer Address:Port               Process                 
     tcp                 LISTEN               0                     511                                           *:http                                          *:*  
     tcp                 LISTEN               0                     128                                           [::]:ssh                                        [::]:* 
     tcp                 LISTEN               0                     128                                           [::]:ipp                                        [::]:*  
     tcp                 LISTEN               0                     128                                           [::]:smtp                                    [::]:* 
 
  
For each entry, verify that the ufw is configured to rate limit the service ports by using the following command:  
  
     $ sudo ufw status  
     Status: active  
  
     To                           Action     From

     25/tcp                    LIMIT       Anywhere 
     Anywhere            DENY       240.9.19.81 
     443                           LIMIT      Anywhere        
     22/tcp                     LIMIT      Anywhere     
     80/tcp (v6)            LIMIT      Anywhere 
     25/tcp (v6)            LIMIT      Anywhere                
     22/tcp (v6)            LIMIT      Anywhere (v6)  
 
     25                             DENY OUT    Anywhere 
     25 (v6)                    DENY OUT    Anywhere (v6) 
 
If any port with a state of "LISTEN" that does not have an action of "DENY", is not marked with the "LIMIT" action, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure the application firewall to protect against or limit the effects of DoS attacks by ensuring Ubuntu 22.04 LTS is implementing rate-limiting measures on impacted network interfaces.  
  
For each service with a port listening to connections, run the following command, replacing "<service_name>" with the service that needs to be rate limited.  
  
     $ sudo ufw limit <service_name>  
  
Rate-limiting can also be done on an interface. An example of adding a rate limit on the "ens160" interface follows:  
  
     $ sudo ufw limit in on ens160

## V-260518

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must be configured to prohibit or restrict the use of functions, ports, protocols, and/or services, as defined in the PPSM CAL and vulnerability assessments.

### Description
To prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of information, or unauthorized tunneling (i.e., embedding of data types within data types), organizations must disable or restrict unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports/protocols on information systems.  
  
Operating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services provided by default may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations. Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single component (e.g., VPN and IPS); however, doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component. 

To support the requirements and principles of least functionality, the operating system must support the organizational requirements, providing only essential capabilities and limiting the use of ports, protocols, and/or services to only those required, authorized, and approved to conduct official business or to address authorized quality of life issues.

### Rule Check
Check the firewall configuration for any unnecessary or prohibited functions, ports, protocols, and/or services by using the following command: 
  
     $ sudo ufw show raw 
     Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)  
          pkts      bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination  
  
     Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)  
         pkts      bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination  
  
     Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)  
         pkts      bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination  
  
Ask the system administrator for the site or program PPSM CLSA. Verify the services allowed by the firewall match the PPSM CLSA.   
  
If there are any additional ports, protocols, or services that are not included in the PPSM CLSA, this is a finding.  
  
If there are any ports, protocols, or services that are prohibited by the PPSM CAL, this is a finding.

### Fix
Add all ports, protocols, or services allowed by the PPSM CLSA by using the following command:  
  
     $ sudo ufw allow <direction> <port/protocol/service>  
  
Where the direction is "in" or "out" and the port is the one corresponding to the protocol or service allowed.  
  
To deny access to ports, protocols, or services, use:  
  
     $ sudo ufw deny <direction> <port/protocol/service>

## V-260519

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must, for networked systems, compare internal information system clocks at least every 24 hours with a server synchronized to one of the redundant United States Naval Observatory (USNO) time servers, or a time server designated for the appropriate DOD network (NIPRNet/SIPRNet), and/or the Global Positioning System (GPS).

### Description
Inaccurate time stamps make it more difficult to correlate events and can lead to an inaccurate analysis. Determining the correct time a particular event occurred on a system is critical when conducting forensic analysis and investigating system events. Sources outside the configured acceptable allowance (drift) may be inaccurate.  
  
Synchronizing internal information system clocks provides uniformity of time stamps for information systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected over a network.  
  
Organizations should consider endpoints that may not have regular access to the authoritative time server (e.g., mobile, teleworking, and tactical endpoints). 
 
Note that USNO offers authenticated NTP service to DOD and U.S. Government agencies operating on the NIPR and SIPR networks. Visit https://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/time/ntp/DOD-customers for more information.

### Rule Check
Verify Ubuntu 22.04 LTS is configured to compare the system clock at least every 24 hours to the authoritative time source by using the following command: 
 
Note: If the system is not networked, this requirement is not applicable. 
 
     $ sudo grep maxpoll -ir /etc/chrony* 
     server tick.usno.navy.mil iburst maxpoll 16 
  
If the "maxpoll" option is set to a number greater than 16, the line is commented out, or is missing, this is a finding. 
  
Verify that the "chrony.conf" file is configured to an authoritative DOD time source by using the following command:  
  
     $ sudo grep -ir server /etc/chrony* 
     server tick.usno.navy.mil iburst maxpoll 16 
     server tock.usno.navy.mil iburst maxpoll 16 
     server ntp2.usno.navy.mil iburst maxpoll 16 
  
If "server" is not defined, is not set to an authoritative DOD time source, is commented out, or missing, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to compare the system clock at least every 24 hours to the authoritative time source. 
 
Add or modify the following line in the "/etc/chrony/chrony.conf" file: 
  
server [source] iburst maxpoll = 16  
  
Restart "chrony.service" for the changes to take effect by using the following command:  
  
     $ sudo systemctl restart chrony.service

## V-260520

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must synchronize internal information system clocks to the authoritative time source when the time difference is greater than one second.

### Description
Inaccurate time stamps make it more difficult to correlate events and can lead to an inaccurate analysis. Determining the correct time a particular event occurred on a system is critical when conducting forensic analysis and investigating system events.  
  
Synchronizing internal information system clocks provides uniformity of time stamps for information systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected over a network. Organizations should consider setting time periods for different types of systems (e.g., financial, legal, or mission-critical systems).  
  
Organizations should also consider endpoints that may not have regular access to the authoritative time server (e.g., mobile, teleworking, and tactical endpoints). This requirement is related to the comparison done every 24 hours in SRG-OS-000355 because a comparison must be done to determine the time difference.

### Rule Check
Verify Ubuntu 22.04 LTS synchronizes internal system clocks to the authoritative time source when the time difference is greater than one second.  
 
Note: If the system is not networked, this requirement is not applicable. 
 
Check the value of "makestep" by using the following command:  
  
     $ grep -ir makestep /etc/chrony* 
     makestep 1 1 
 
If "makestep" is not set to "1 1", is commented out, or is missing, this is a finding. 
 
Verify the NTP service is active and the system clock is synchronized with the authoritative time source: 
 
     $ timedatectl | grep -Ei '(synchronized|service)' 
     System clock synchronized: yes 
     NTP service: active 
 
If the NTP service is not active, this is a finding.

If the system clock is not synchronized, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure chrony to synchronize the internal system clocks to the authoritative source when the time difference is greater than one second by doing the following:  
  
Edit the "/etc/chrony/chrony.conf" file and add:  
 
     makestep 1 1 
 
Restart the chrony service:  
  
     $ sudo systemctl restart chrony.service

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must record time stamps for audit records that can be mapped to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

### Description
If time stamps are not consistently applied and there is no common time reference, it is difficult to perform forensic analysis.  
  
Time stamps generated by the operating system include date and time. Time is commonly expressed in UTC or local time with an offset from UTC.

### Rule Check
Verify the time zone is configured to use UTC by using the following command:  
  
     $ timedatectl status | grep -i "time zone" 
     Time zone: Etc/UTC (UTC, +0000) 
  
If "Time zone" is not set to UTC, this is a finding.

### Fix
To Configure Ubuntu 22.04 LTS time zone to use UTC, run the following command: 
  
     $ sudo timedatectl set-timezone Etc/UTC

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must be configured to use TCP syncookies.

### Description
DoS is a condition when a resource is not available for legitimate users. When this occurs, the organization either cannot accomplish its mission or must operate at degraded capacity.   
  
Managing excess capacity ensures that sufficient capacity is available to counter flooding attacks. Employing increased capacity and service redundancy may reduce the susceptibility to some DoS attacks. Managing excess capacity may include, for example, establishing selected usage priorities, quotas, or partitioning.

### Rule Check
Verify Ubuntu 22.04 LTS is configured to use TCP syncookies by using the following command: 
 
     $ sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies 
     net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1 
 
If the value is not "1", this is a finding. 
  
Check the saved value of TCP syncookies by using the following command:  
  
     $ sudo grep -ir net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies /etc/sysctl.d/*.conf /run/sysctl.d/*.conf /usr/local/lib/sysctl.d/*.conf /usr/lib/sysctl.d/*.conf /lib/sysctl.d/*.conf /etc/sysctl.conf 2> /dev/null 
 
If the "net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies" option is not set to "1", is commented out, or is missing, this is a finding. 
 
If conflicting results are returned, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to use TCP syncookies by using the following command:  
  
     $ sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1  
  
If "1" is not the system's default value, add or update the following line in "/etc/sysctl.conf":  
  
     net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must have SSH installed.

### Description
Without protection of the transmitted information, confidentiality and integrity may be compromised because unprotected communications can be intercepted and either read or altered.   
  
This requirement applies to both internal and external networks and all types of information system components from which information can be transmitted (e.g., servers, mobile devices, notebook computers, printers, copiers, scanners, and facsimile machines). Communication paths outside the physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception and modification.   
  
Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of organizational information can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., employing physical distribution systems) or by logical means (e.g., employing cryptographic techniques). If physical means of protection are employed, then logical means (cryptography) do not have to be employed, and vice versa.

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must display the Standard Mandatory DOD Notice and Consent Banner before granting any local or remote connection to the system.

### Description
Display of a standardized and approved use notification before granting access to the publicly accessible operating system ensures privacy and security notification verbiage used is consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.  
  
System use notifications are required only for access via logon interfaces with human users and are not required when such human interfaces do not exist.  
  
The banner must be formatted in accordance with applicable DOD policy. Use the following verbiage for operating systems that can accommodate banners of 1300 characters:  
  
"You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided for USG-authorized use only.  
  
By using this IS (which includes any device attached to this IS), you consent to the following conditions:  
  
-The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS for purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC monitoring, network operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations.  
  
-At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.  
  
-Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any USG-authorized purpose.  
  
-This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls) to protect USG interests--not for your personal benefit or privacy.  
  
-Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent to PM, LE or CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content of privileged communications, or work product, related to personal representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants. Such communications and work product are private and confidential. See User Agreement for details."

## V-260527

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must be configured so that all network connections associated with SSH traffic terminate after becoming unresponsive.

### Description
Terminating an unresponsive SSH session within a short time period reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a management session enabled on the console or console port that has been left unattended. In addition, quickly terminating an idle SSH session will also free up resources committed by the managed network element. 
 
Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, deallocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level and deallocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection. This does not mean the operating system terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the unresponsive session and releases the resources associated with that session.

### Rule Check
Verify the SSH server automatically terminates a user session after the SSH client has become unresponsive by using the following command:  
 
     $ sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -dd 2>&1 | awk '/filename/ {print $4}' | tr -d '\r' | tr '\n' ' ' | xargs sudo grep -iH 'clientalivecountmax' 
     /etc/ssh/sshd_config:ClientAliveCountMax 1 
 
If "ClientAliveCountMax" is not to "1", if conflicting results are returned, is commented out, or is missing, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure the SSH server to terminate a user session automatically after the SSH client has become unresponsive. 
 
Note: This setting must be applied in conjunction with UBTU-22-255040 to function correctly. 
 
Add or modify the following line in the "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" file: 
  
ClientAliveCountMax 1 
  
Restart the SSH daemon for the changes to take effect:

## V-260529

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must be configured so that remote X connections are disabled, unless to fulfill documented and validated mission requirements.

### Description
The security risk of using X11 forwarding is that the client's X11 display server may be exposed to attack when the SSH client requests forwarding.  A system administrator may have a stance in which they want to protect clients that may expose themselves to attack by unwittingly requesting X11 forwarding, which can warrant a ''no'' setting.  
  
X11 forwarding should be enabled with caution. Users with the ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for the user's X11 authorization database) can access the local X11 display through the forwarded connection. An attacker may then be able to perform activities such as keystroke monitoring if the ForwardX11Trusted option is also enabled.  
  
If X11 services are not required for the system's intended function, they should be disabled or restricted as appropriate to the system's needs.

### Rule Check
Verify that X11 forwarding is disabled by using the following command:  
 
     $ sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -dd 2>&1 | awk '/filename/ {print $4}' | tr -d '\r' | tr '\n' ' ' | xargs sudo grep -iH 'x11forwarding' 
     /etc/ssh/sshd_config:X11Forwarding no 
  
If "X11Forwarding" is set to "yes" and is not documented with the information system security officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement, is commented out, is missing, or conflicting results are returned, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure the SSH server to disable X11 forwarding.  
 
Add or modify the following line in the "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" file: 
 
X11Forwarding no  
  
Restart the SSH daemon for the changes to take effect:

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS SSH daemon must prevent remote hosts from connecting to the proxy display.

### Description
When X11 forwarding is enabled, there may be additional exposure to the server and client displays if the sshd proxy display is configured to listen on the wildcard address. By default, sshd binds the forwarding server to the loopback address and sets the hostname part of the DISPLAY environment variable to localhost. This prevents remote hosts from connecting to the proxy display.

### Rule Check
Verify the SSH server prevents remote hosts from connecting to the proxy display by using the following command: 
 
     $ sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -dd 2>&1 | awk '/filename/ {print $4}' | tr -d '\r' | tr '\n' ' ' | xargs sudo grep -iH 'x11uselocalhost' 
     /etc/ssh/sshd_config:X11UseLocalhost yes 
 
If "X11UseLocalhost" is set to "no", is commented out, is missing, or conflicting results are returned, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure the SSH server to prevent remote hosts from connecting to the proxy display.  
  
Add or modify the following line in the "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" file:

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must configure the SSH daemon to use FIPS 140-3-approved ciphers to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information and/or detect changes to information during transmission.

### Description
Without cryptographic integrity protections, information can be altered by unauthorized users without detection.   
  
Remote access (e.g., RDP) is access to DOD nonpublic information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, nonorganization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.   
  
Nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities conducted by individuals communicating through a network, either an external network (e.g., the internet) or an internal network.   
  
Local maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities carried out by individuals physically present at the information system or information system component and not communicating across a network connection.   
  
Encrypting information for transmission protects information from unauthorized disclosure and modification. Cryptographic mechanisms implemented to protect information integrity include, for example, cryptographic hash functions which have common application in digital signatures, checksums, and message authentication codes.  
  
By specifying a cipher list with the order of ciphers being in a "strongest to weakest" orientation, the system will automatically attempt to use the strongest cipher for securing SSH connections.

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must use strong authenticators in establishing nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions.

### Description
Nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities conducted by individuals communicating through a network, either an external network (e.g., the internet) or an internal network. Local maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities carried out by individuals physically present at the information system or information system component and not communicating across a network connection. Typically, strong authentication requires authenticators that are resistant to replay attacks and employ multifactor authentication. Strong authenticators include, for example, PKI where certificates are stored on a token protected by a password, passphrase, or biometric.

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must retain a user's session lock until that user reestablishes access using established identification and authentication procedures.

### Description
A session lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system but does not want to log out because of the temporary nature of the absence.  
  
The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be determined.  
  
Regardless of where the session lock is determined and implemented, once invoked, a session lock of Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must remain in place until the user reauthenticates. No other activity aside from reauthentication must unlock the system.

### Rule Check
Verify Ubuntu 22.04 LTS has a graphical user interface session lock enabled by using the following command: 
  
Note: If no graphical user interface is installed, this requirement is not applicable. 
  
     $ sudo gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.screensaver lock-enabled 
     true 
  
If "lock-enabled" is not set to "true", is commented out, or is missing, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to allow a user to lock the current graphical user interface session.

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must disable the x86 Ctrl-Alt-Delete key sequence if a graphical user interface is installed.

### Description
A locally logged-on user who presses Ctrl-Alt-Delete, when at the console, can reboot the system. If accidentally pressed, as could happen in the case of a mixed OS environment, this can create the risk of short-term loss of availability of systems due to unintentional reboot. In the graphical environment, risk of unintentional reboot from the Ctrl-Alt-Delete sequence is reduced because the user will be prompted before any action is taken.

### Rule Check
Verify Ubuntu 22.04 LTS is not configured to reboot the system when Ctrl-Alt-Delete is pressed when using a graphical user interface by using the following command: 
 
Note: If no graphical user interface is installed, this requirement is not applicable. 
 
     $ gsettings get org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys logout 
     @as [] 
 
If the "logout" key is bound to an action, is commented out, or is missing, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to disable the Ctrl-Alt-Delete sequence when using a graphical user interface. 
 
     $ gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys logout []

## V-260541

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must disable all wireless network adapters.

### Description
Without protection of communications with wireless peripherals, confidentiality and integrity may be compromised because unprotected communications can be intercepted and either read, altered, or used to compromise the operating system.  
  
This requirement applies to wireless peripheral technologies (e.g., wireless mice, keyboards, displays, etc.) used with an operating system. Wireless peripherals (e.g., Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/IR Keyboards, Mice, and Pointing Devices and Near Field Communications [NFC]) present a unique challenge by creating an open, unsecured port on a computer. Wireless peripherals must meet DOD requirements for wireless data transmission and be approved for use by the AO. Even though some wireless peripherals, such as mice and pointing devices, do not ordinarily carry information that need to be protected, modification of communications with these wireless peripherals may be used to compromise the operating system. Communication paths outside the physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception and modification.  
  
Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of communications with wireless peripherals can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., employing physical barriers to wireless radio frequencies) or by logical means (e.g., employing cryptographic techniques). If physical means of protection are employed, then logical means (cryptography) do not have to be employed, and vice versa. If the wireless peripheral is only passing telemetry data, encryption of the data may not be required.

### Rule Check
Verify that there are no wireless interfaces configured on the system by using the following command:  
 
Note: If the system does not have any physical wireless network radios, this requirement is not applicable.  
  
     $ cat /proc/net/wireless 
  
If any wireless interface names are listed under "Interface" and have not been documented and approved by the information system security officer (ISSO), this is a finding.

### Fix
Disable all wireless network interfaces by using the following command: 
  
     $ sudo ifdown <wireless_interface_name>  
  
For each interface listed, find their respective module by using the following command:  
  
     $ basename $(readlink -f /sys/class/net/<wireless_interface_name>/device/driver)  
  
where <wireless_interface_name> must be substituted by the actual interface name.  
 
Create and/or append a custom file under "/etc/modprobe.d/" by using the following command: 
 
     $ sudo su -c "echo install <module_name> /bin/false >> /etc/modprobe.d/stig.conf" 
 
where <module_name> must be substituted by the actual module name. 
 
For each module from the system, execute the following command to remove it:  
  
     $ sudo modprobe -r <module_name>

## V-260542

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must prevent direct login into the root account.

### Description
To ensure individual accountability and prevent unauthorized access, organizational users must be individually identified and authenticated.  
  
A group authenticator is a generic account used by multiple individuals. Use of a group authenticator alone does not uniquely identify individual users. Examples of the group authenticator is the Unix OS "root" user account, the Windows "Administrator" account, the "sa" account, or a "helpdesk" account.  
  
For example, the Unix and Windows operating systems offer a "switch user" capability allowing users to authenticate with their individual credentials and, when needed, "switch" to the administrator role. This method provides for unique individual authentication prior to using a group authenticator.  
  
Users (and any processes acting on behalf of users) must be uniquely identified and authenticated for all accesses other than those accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization, which outlines specific user actions that can be performed on the operating system without identification or authentication.  
  
Requiring individuals to be authenticated with an individual authenticator prior to using a group authenticator allows for traceability of actions, as well as adding an additional level of protection of the actions that can be taken with group account knowledge.

### Rule Check
Verify Ubuntu 22.04 LTS prevents direct logins to the root account by using the following command:  
  
     $ sudo passwd -S root  
     root L 08/09/2022 0 99999 7 -1 
  
If the output does not contain "L" in the second field to indicate the account is locked, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to prevent direct logins to the root account by using the following command:  
  
     $ sudo passwd -l root

## V-260543

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must uniquely identify interactive users.

### Description
To ensure accountability and prevent unauthenticated access, organizational users must be identified and authenticated to prevent potential misuse and compromise of the system.  
  
Organizational users include organizational employees or individuals the organization deems to have equivalent status of employees (e.g., contractors). Organizational users (and processes acting on behalf of users) must be uniquely identified and authenticated to all accesses, except for the following:   
  
1. Accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization. Organizations document specific user actions that can be performed on the information system without identification or authentication; and  
  
2. Accesses that occur through authorized use of group authenticators without individual authentication. Organizations may require unique identification of individuals in group accounts (e.g., shared privilege accounts) or for detailed accountability of individual activity.

## V-260545

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must enforce 24 hours/one day as the minimum password lifetime. Passwords for new users must have a 24 hours/one day minimum password lifetime restriction.

### Description
Enforcing a minimum password lifetime helps to prevent repeated password changes to defeat the password reuse or history enforcement requirement. If users are allowed to immediately and continually change their password, then the password could be repeatedly changed in a short period of time to defeat the organization's policy regarding password reuse.

### Rule Check
Verify Ubuntu 22.04 LTS enforces a 24 hours/one day minimum password lifetime for new user accounts by using the following command:  
  
     $ grep -i pass_min_days /etc/login.defs 
     PASS_MIN_DAYS    1  
  
If "PASS_MIN_DAYS" is less than "1", is commented out, or is missing, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to enforce a 24 hours/one day minimum password lifetime.  
  
Add or modify the following line in the "/etc/login.defs" file:  
  
PASS_MIN_DAYS    1

## V-260546

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must enforce a 60-day maximum password lifetime restriction. Passwords for new users must have a 60-day maximum password lifetime restriction.

### Description
Any password, no matter how complex, can eventually be cracked. Therefore, passwords need to be changed periodically. If the operating system does not limit the lifetime of passwords and force users to change their passwords, there is the risk that the operating system passwords could be compromised.

### Rule Check
Verify Ubuntu 22.04 LTS enforces a 60-day maximum password lifetime for new user accounts by using the following command: 
  
     $ grep -i pass_max_days /etc/login.defs 
     PASS_MAX_DAYS    60  
 
If "PASS_MAX_DAYS" is less than "60", is commented out, or is missing, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to enforce a 60-day maximum password lifetime.  
  
Add or modify the following line in the "/etc/login.defs" file:  
  
PASS_MAX_DAYS    60

## V-260547

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must disable account identifiers (individuals, groups, roles, and devices) after 35 days of inactivity.

### Description
Inactive identifiers pose a risk to systems and applications because attackers may exploit an inactive identifier and potentially obtain undetected access to the system. Owners of inactive accounts will not notice if unauthorized access to their user account has been obtained.  
  
Operating systems need to track periods of inactivity and disable application identifiers after 35 days of inactivity.

### Rule Check
Verify the account identifiers (individuals, groups, roles, and devices) are disabled after 35 days of inactivity by using the following command:  
  
Check the account inactivity value by performing the following command:  
  
     $ grep INACTIVE /etc/default/useradd  
     INACTIVE=35  
  
If "INACTIVE" is set to "-1" or is not set to "35", is commented out, or is missing, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to disable account identifiers after 35 days of inactivity after the password expiration.   
  
Run the following command to change the configuration for adduser:  
  
     $ sudo useradd -D -f 35 
  
Note: DOD recommendation is 35 days, but a lower value is acceptable. The value "0" will disable the account immediately after the password expires.

## V-260548

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must automatically expire temporary accounts within 72 hours.

### Description
Temporary accounts are privileged or nonprivileged accounts established during pressing circumstances, such as new software or hardware configuration or an incident response, where the need for prompt account activation requires bypassing normal account authorization procedures. If any inactive temporary accounts are left enabled on the system and are not either manually removed or automatically expired within 72 hours, the security posture of the system will be degraded and exposed to exploitation by unauthorized users or insider threat actors. 
 
Temporary accounts are different from emergency accounts. Emergency accounts, also known as "last resort" or "break glass" accounts, are local logon accounts enabled on the system for emergency use by authorized system administrators to manage a system when standard logon methods are failing or not available. Emergency accounts are not subject to manual removal or scheduled expiration requirements. 
 
The automatic expiration of temporary accounts may be extended as needed by the circumstances, but it must not be extended indefinitely. A documented permanent account should be established for privileged users who need long-term maintenance accounts.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000002-GPOS-00002, SRG-OS-000123-GPOS-00064

### Rule Check
Verify temporary accounts have been provisioned with an expiration date of 72 hours by using the following command: 
 
     $ sudo chage -l <temporary_account_name> | grep -E '(Password|Account) expires' 
     Password expires     : Apr 1, 2024  
     Account expires        : Apr 1, 2024  
 
Verify each of these accounts has an expiration date set within 72 hours. 
 
If any temporary accounts have no expiration date set or do not expire within 72 hours, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to expire temporary accounts after 72 hours by using the following command: 
 
     $ sudo chage -E $(date -d +3days +%Y-%m-%d) <temporary_account_name>

## V-260549

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must automatically lock an account until the locked account is released by an administrator when three unsuccessful logon attempts have been made.

### Description
By limiting the number of failed logon attempts, the risk of unauthorized system access via user password guessing, otherwise known as brute-forcing, is reduced. Limits are imposed by locking the account.

auth     sufficient     pam_faillock.so authsucc 
 
If the "pam_faillock.so" module is not present in the "/etc/pam.d/common-auth" file, this is a finding. 
 
Verify the "pam_faillock" module is configured to use the following options: 
 
     $ sudo grep -Ew 'silent|audit|deny|fail_interval|unlock_time' /etc/security/faillock.conf 
     audit 
     silent 
     deny = 3 
     fail_interval = 900 
     unlock_time = 0 
 
If "audit" is commented out, or is missing, this is a finding.

If "silent" is commented out, or is missing, this is a finding.

If "deny" is set to a value greater than "3", is commented out, or is missing, this is a finding.
 
If "fail_interval" is set to a value greater than "900", is commented out, or is missing, this is a finding.

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must allow users to directly initiate a session lock for all connection types.

### Description
A session lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system but does not want to log out because of the temporary nature of the absence.  
  
The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be determined. Rather than be forced to wait for a period of time to expire before the user session can be locked, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS need to provide users with the ability to manually invoke a session lock so users may secure their session if they need to temporarily vacate the immediate physical vicinity.

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must have the "apparmor" package installed.

### Description
Control of program execution is a mechanism used to prevent execution of unauthorized programs. Some operating systems may provide a capability that runs counter to the mission or provides users with functionality that exceeds mission requirements. This includes functions and services installed at the operating system level.  
  
Some of the programs, installed by default, may be harmful or may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions). Removal of executable programs is not always possible; therefore, establishing a method of preventing program execution is critical to maintaining a secure system baseline.  
  
Methods for complying with this requirement include restricting execution of programs in certain environments, while preventing execution in other environments; or limiting execution of certain program functionality based on organization-defined criteria (e.g., privileges, subnets, sandboxed environments, or roles).

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must ensure only users who need access to security functions are part of sudo group.

### Description
An isolation boundary provides access control and protects the integrity of the hardware, software, and firmware that perform security functions.  
  
Security functions are the hardware, software, and/or firmware of the information system responsible for enforcing the system security policy and supporting the isolation of code and data on which the protection is based. Operating systems implement code separation (i.e., separation of security functions from nonsecurity functions) in a number of ways, including through the provision of security kernels via processor rings or processor modes. For nonkernel code, security function isolation is often achieved through file system protections that serve to protect the code on disk and address space protections that protect executing code.  
  
Developers and implementers can increase the assurance in security functions by employing well-defined security policy models; structured, disciplined, and rigorous hardware and software development techniques; and sound system/security engineering principles. Implementation may include isolation of memory space and libraries.   
  
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS restricts access to security functions through the use of access control mechanisms and by implementing least privilege capabilities.

### Rule Check
Verify the sudo group has only members who require access to security functions by using the following command:   
  
     $ grep sudo /etc/group

## V-260573

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must implement multifactor authentication for remote access to privileged accounts in such a way that one of the factors is provided by a device separate from the system gaining access.

### Description
Using an authentication device, such as a CAC or token separate from the information system, ensures that even if the information system is compromised, that compromise will not affect credentials stored on the authentication device.  
  
Multifactor solutions that require devices separate from information systems gaining access include, for example, hardware tokens providing time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such as the U.S. Government personal identity verification card and the DOD common access card.  
  
A privileged account is defined as an information system account with authorizations of a privileged user.  
  
Remote access is access to DOD nonpublic information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, nonorganization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.  
  
This requirement only applies to components where this is specific to the function of the device or has the concept of an organizational user (e.g., VPN, proxy capability). This does not apply to authentication for the purpose of configuring the device itself (management).

The use of PIV credentials facilitates standardization and reduces the risk of unauthorized access.  
  
DOD has mandated the use of the common access card (CAC) to support identity management and personal authentication for systems covered under Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 12, as well as making the CAC a primary component of layered protection for national security systems.

### Rule Check
Verify the "opensc-pcks11" package is installed on the system by using the following command:  
  
     $ dpkg -l | grep opensc-pkcs11 
     ii     opensc-pkcs11:amd64     0.22.0-1Ubuntu2     amd64     Smart card utilities with support for PKCS#15 compatible cards  
  
If the "opensc-pcks11" package is not installed, this is a finding.

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must implement smart card logins for multifactor authentication for local and network access to privileged and nonprivileged accounts.

### Description
Without the use of multifactor authentication, the ease of access to privileged functions is greatly increased.  
  
Multifactor authentication requires using two or more factors to achieve authentication.  
  
Factors include:   
1) Something a user knows (e.g., password/PIN);  
2) Something a user has (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); and  
3) Something a user is (e.g., biometric).  
  
A privileged account is defined as an information system account with authorizations of a privileged user.  
  
Network access is defined as access to an information system by a user (or a process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through a network (e.g., local area network, wide area network, or the internet).  
  
The DOD common access card (CAC) with DOD-approved PKI is an example of multifactor authentication.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000105-GPOS-00052, SRG-OS-000106-GPOS-00053, SRG-OS-000107-GPOS-00054, SRG-OS-000108-GPOS-00055

### Rule Check
Verify that the "pam_pkcs11.so" module is configured by using the following command: 
 
     $ grep -i pam_pkcs11.so /etc/pam.d/common-auth 
     auth     [success=2 default=ignore]     pam_pkcs11.so  
 
If "pam_pkcs11.so" is commented out, or is missing, this is a finding. 
 
Verify the sshd daemon allows public key authentication by using the following command: 
  
     $ sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -dd 2>&1 | awk '/filename/ {print $4}' | tr -d '\r' | tr '\n' ' ' | xargs sudo grep -iH 'pubkeyauthentication' 
     /etc/ssh/sshd_config:PubkeyAuthentication yes 
 
If "PubkeyAuthentication" is not set to "yes", is commented out, is missing, or conflicting results are returned, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to use multifactor authentication for access to accounts.  
  
Add or modify the following line in the "/etc/pam.d/common-auth" file: 
  
auth     [success=2 default=ignore]     pam_pkcs11.so  
  
Add or modify the following line in the "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" file: 
 
PubkeyAuthentication yes

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must electronically verify personal identity verification (PIV) credentials.

### Description
The use of PIV credentials facilitates standardization and reduces the risk of unauthorized access.  
  
DOD has mandated the use of the common access card (CAC) to support identity management and personal authentication for systems covered under Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 12, as well as making the CAC a primary component of layered protection for national security systems.

### Rule Check
Verify Ubuntu 22.04 LTS electronically verifies PIV credentials via certificate status checking by using the following command:  
  
     $ sudo grep use_pkcs11_module /etc/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.conf | awk '/pkcs11_module opensc {/,/}/' /etc/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.conf | grep cert_policy | grep ocsp_on 
     cert_policy = ca,signature,ocsp_on;  
  
If every returned "cert_policy" line is not set to "ocsp_on", the line is commented out, or is missing, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to do certificate status checking for multifactor authentication.  
 
Add or modify all "cert_policy" lines in the "/etc/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.conf" file with the following: 
 
ocsp_on

## V-260577

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, for PKI-based authentication, must validate certificates by constructing a certification path (which includes status information) to an accepted trust anchor.

### Description
Without path validation, an informed trust decision by the relying party cannot be made when presented with any certificate not already explicitly trusted.  
  
A trust anchor is an authoritative entity represented via a public key and associated data. It is used in the context of public key infrastructures, X.509 digital certificates, and DNSSEC.  
  
When there is a chain of trust, usually the top entity to be trusted becomes the trust anchor; it can be, for example, a certification authority (CA). A certification path starts with the subject certificate and proceeds through a number of intermediate certificates up to a trusted root certificate, typically issued by a trusted CA.  
  
This requirement verifies that a certification path to an accepted trust anchor is used for certificate validation and that the path includes status information. Path validation is necessary for a relying party to make an informed trust decision when presented with any certificate not already explicitly trusted. Status information for certification paths includes certificate revocation lists or online certificate status protocol responses. Validation of the certificate status information is out of scope for this requirement.

### Rule Check
Verify Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, for PKI-based authentication, has valid certificates by constructing a certification path to an accepted trust anchor.  
  
Determine which pkcs11 module is being used via the "use_pkcs11_module" in "/etc/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.conf" and then ensure "ca" is enabled in "cert_policy" by using the following command:  
   
     $ sudo grep use_pkcs11_module /etc/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.conf | awk '/pkcs11_module opensc {/,/}/' /etc/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.conf | grep cert_policy | grep ca   
     cert_policy = ca,signature,ocsp_on;  
  
If "cert_policy" is not set to "ca", the line is commented out, or is missing, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, for PKI-based authentication, to validate certificates by constructing a certification path to an accepted trust anchor.  
  
Add or modify all "cert_policy" lines in the "/etc/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.conf" file with the following: 
 
cert_policy = ca,signature,ocsp_on;  
  
Note: If the system is missing an "/etc/pam_pkcs11/" directory and an "/etc/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.conf", find an example to copy into place and modify accordingly at "/usr/share/doc/libpam-pkcs11/examples/pam_pkcs11.conf.example.gz".

## V-260578

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS for PKI-based authentication, must implement a local cache of revocation data in case of the inability to access revocation information via the network.

### Description
Without configuring a local cache of revocation data, there is the potential to allow access to users who are no longer authorized (users with revoked certificates).

### Rule Check
Verify Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, for PKI-based authentication, uses local revocation data when unable to access it from the network by using the following command: 
 
Note: If smart card authentication is not being used on the system, this is not applicable.  
  
     $ grep cert_policy /etc/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.conf | grep  -E -- 'crl_auto|crl_offline' 
     cert_policy = ca,signature,ocsp_on,crl_auto; 
  
If "cert_policy" is not set to include "crl_auto" or "crl_offline", is commented out, or is missing, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, for PKI-based authentication, to use local revocation data when unable to access the network to obtain it remotely.  
  
Add or update the "cert_policy" option in "/etc/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.conf" to include "crl_auto" or "crl_offline".  
  
cert_policy = ca,signature,ocsp_on, crl_auto;  
  
If the system is missing an "/etc/pam_pkcs11/" directory and an "/etc/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.conf", find an example to copy into place and modify accordingly at "/usr/share/doc/libpam-pkcs11/examples/pam_pkcs11.conf.example.gz".

## V-260579

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must map the authenticated identity to the user or group account for PKI-based authentication.

### Description
Without mapping the certificate used to authenticate to the user account, the ability to determine the identity of the individual user or group will not be available for forensic analysis.

### Rule Check
Verify that "use_mappers" is set to "pwent" in "/etc/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.conf" file by using the following command:  
  
     $ grep -i use_mappers /etc/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.conf 
     use_mappers = pwent 
  
If "use_mappers" does not contain "pwent", is commented out, or is missing, this is a finding.

### Fix
Set "use_mappers=pwent" in "/etc/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.conf" or, if there is already a comma-separated list of mappers, add it to the list, separated by comma, and before the null mapper.  
  
If the system is missing an "/etc/pam_pkcs11/" directory and an "/etc/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.conf", find an example to copy into place and modify accordingly at "/usr/share/doc/libpam-pkcs11/examples/pam_pkcs11.conf.example.gz".

## V-260580

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must use DOD PKI-established certificate authorities for verification of the establishment of protected sessions.

### Description
Untrusted certificate authorities (CA) can issue certificates, but they may be issued by organizations or individuals that seek to compromise DOD systems or by organizations with insufficient security controls. If the CA used for verifying the certificate is not a DOD-approved CA, trust of this CA has not been established.  
  
The DOD will only accept PKI-certificates obtained from a DOD-approved internal or external certificate authority. Reliance on CAs for the establishment of secure sessions includes, for example, the use of SSL/TLS certificates.

### Rule Check
Verify the directory containing the root certificates for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS contains certificate files for DOD PKI-established certificate authorities by iterating over all files in the "/etc/ssl/certs" directory and checking if, at least one, has the subject matching "DOD ROOT CA". 
 
     $ ls /etc/ssl/certs | grep -i DOD 
     DOD_PKE_CA_chain.pem 
 
If no DOD root certificate is found, this is a finding. 
 
Verify that all root certificates present on the system have been approved by the AO. 
 
     $ ls /etc/ssl/certs 
 
If a certificate is present that is not approved by the AO, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to use of DOD PKI-established certificate authorities for verification of the establishment of protected sessions.  
 
Add at least one DOD certificate authority to the "/usr/share/ca-certificates" directory in the CRT format.  
  
Update the "/etc/ssl/certs" directory by using the following command:  
  
     $ sudo dpkg-reconfigure ca-certificates

## V-260581

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must be configured such that Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) prohibits the use of cached authentications after one day.

### Description
If cached authentication information is out-of-date, the validity of the authentication information may be questionable.

### Rule Check
Verify that PAM prohibits the use of cached authentications after one day by using the following command: 
 
Note: If smart card authentication is not being used on the system, this requirement is not applicable.  
  
     $ sudo grep -i '^\s*offline_credentials_expiration' /etc/sssd/sssd.conf /etc/sssd/conf.d/*.conf 
     /etc/sssd/sssd.conf:offline_credentials_expiration = 1 
 
If "offline_credentials_expiration" is not set to "1", is commented out, is missing, or conflicting results are returned, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure PAM to prohibit the use of cached authentications after one day.  
 
Add or modify the following line in the "/etc/sssd/sssd.conf" file, just below the line "[pam]": 
  
offline_credentials_expiration = 1 
  
Note: It is valid for this configuration to be in a file with a name that ends with ".conf" and does not begin with a "." in the "/etc/sssd/conf.d/" directory instead of the "/etc/sssd/sssd.conf" file.

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must use a file integrity tool to verify correct operation of all security functions.

### Description
Without verification of the security functions, security functions may not operate correctly and the failure may go unnoticed. Security function is defined as the hardware, software, and/or firmware of the information system responsible for enforcing the system security policy and supporting the isolation of code and data on which the protection is based. Security functionality includes, but is not limited to, establishing system accounts, configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting events to be audited, and setting intrusion detection parameters.  
  
This requirement applies to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS performing security function verification/testing and/or systems and environments that require this functionality.

### Rule Check
Verify that Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) is installed by using the following command: 
 
     $ dpkg -l | grep aide 
     ii     aide     0.17.4-1     amd64     Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment - dynamic binary 
 
If AIDE is not installed, ask the system administrator how file integrity checks are performed on the system.  
 
If there is no application installed to perform integrity checks, this is a finding.

### Fix
Install the "aide" package: 
 
     $ sudo apt install aide

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must notify designated personnel if baseline configurations are changed in an unauthorized manner. The file integrity tool must notify the system administrator when changes to the baseline configuration or anomalies in the operation of any security functions are discovered.

### Description
Unauthorized changes to the baseline configuration could make the system vulnerable to various attacks or allow unauthorized access to the operating system. Changes to operating system configurations can have unintended side effects, some of which may be relevant to security.  
  
Detecting such changes and providing an automated response can help avoid unintended, negative consequences that could ultimately affect the security state of the operating system. The operating system's IMO/ISSO and SAs must be notified via email and/or monitoring system trap when there is an unauthorized modification of a configuration item.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000363-GPOS-00150, SRG-OS-000447-GPOS-00201

### Rule Check

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must be configured so that the script that runs each 30 days or less to check file integrity is the default.

### Description
Without verification of the security functions, security functions may not operate correctly and the failure may go unnoticed. Security function is defined as the hardware, software, and/or firmware of the information system responsible for enforcing the system security policy and supporting the isolation of code and data on which the protection is based. Security functionality includes, but is not limited to, establishing system accounts, configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting events to be audited, and setting intrusion detection parameters.  
  
Notifications provided by information systems include, for example, electronic alerts to system administrators, messages to local computer consoles, and/or hardware indications, such as lights.  
  
This requirement applies to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS performing security function verification/testing and/or systems and environments that require this functionality.

### Rule Check
Verify that the Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) default script used to check file integrity each 30 days or less is unchanged.  
  
Download the original aide-common package in the /tmp directory:  
  
     $ cd /tmp; apt download aide-common 
  
Fetch the SHA1 of the original script file: 
  
     $ dpkg-deb --fsys-tarfile /tmp/aide-common_*.deb | tar -xO ./usr/share/aide/config/cron.daily/aide | sha1sum 
     b71bb2cafaedf15ec3ac2f566f209d3260a37af0  -  
  
Compare with the SHA1 of the file in the daily or monthly cron directory:  
  
     $ sha1sum /etc/cron.{daily,monthly}/aide 2>/dev/null 
     b71bb2cafaedf15ec3ac2f566f209d3260a37af0  /etc/cron.daily/aide 
  
If there is no AIDE script file in the cron directories, or the SHA1 value of at least one file in the daily or monthly cron directory does not match the SHA1 of the original, this is a finding.

### Fix
The cron file for AIDE is fairly complex as it creates the report. This file is installed with the "aide-common" package, and the default can be restored by copying it from the package:  
 
Extract the aide script from the "aide-common" package to its original place:  
  
     $ dpkg-deb --fsys-tarfile /tmp/aide-common_*.deb | sudo tar -x ./usr/share/aide/config/cron.daily/aide -C / 
 
Copy it to the cron.daily directory: 
 
     $  sudo cp -f /usr/share/aide/config/cron.daily/aide /etc/cron.daily/aide

## V-260586

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must use cryptographic mechanisms to protect the integrity of audit tools.

### Description
Protecting the integrity of the tools used for auditing purposes is a critical step toward ensuring the integrity of audit information. Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings, and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system activity.  
  
Audit tools include, but are not limited to, vendor-provided and open source audit tools needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information system activity and records. Audit tools include custom queries and report generators.  
  
It is not uncommon for attackers to replace the audit tools or inject code into the existing tools with the purpose of providing the capability to hide or erase system activity from the audit logs.  
  
To address this risk, audit tools must be cryptographically signed in order to provide the capability to identify when the audit tools have been modified, manipulated, or replaced. An example is a checksum hash of the file or files.

### Rule Check
Verify that Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) is properly configured to use cryptographic mechanisms to protect the integrity of audit tools by using the following command:  
  
     $ grep -E '(\/sbin\/(audit|au))' /etc/aide/aide.conf 
     /sbin/auditctl p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512  
     /sbin/auditd p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512

     /sbin/audispd p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512  
     /sbin/augenrules p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512  
  
If any of the seven lines do not appear as shown, are commented out, or are missing, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure AIDE to protect the integrity of audit tools: 
 
Add or modify the following lines in the "/etc/aide/aide.conf" file: 
 
# Audit Tools  
/sbin/auditctl p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512  
/sbin/auditd p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must have a crontab script running weekly to offload audit events of standalone systems.

### Description
Information stored in one location is vulnerable to accidental or incidental deletion or alteration.  
  
Offloading is a common process in information systems with limited audit storage capacity.

### Rule Check
Verify there is a script that offloads audit data and that script runs weekly by using the following command: 
 
Note: If the system is not connected to a network, this requirement is not applicable. 
  
     $ ls /etc/cron.weekly 
     <audit_offload_script_name> 
  
Check if the script inside the file does offloading of audit logs to external media.  
  
If the script file does not exist or does not offload audit logs, this is a finding.

### Fix
Create a script that offloads audit logs to external media and runs weekly.  
  
The script must be located in the "/etc/cron.weekly" directory.

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must be configured to preserve log records from failure events.

### Description
Failure to a known state can address safety or security in accordance with the mission/business needs of the organization. Failure to a known secure state helps prevent a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability in the event of a failure of the information system or a component of the system.   
  
Preserving operating system state information helps to facilitate operating system restart and return to the operational mode of the organization with least disruption to mission/business processes.

### Rule Check
Verify the log service is installed properly by using the following command:  
  
     $ dpkg -l | grep rsyslog 
     ii     rsyslog     8.2112.0-2ubuntu2.2     amd64     reliable system and kernel logging daemon 
  
If the "rsyslog" package is not installed, this is a finding.  
  
Check that the log service is enabled and active by using the following commands:  
 
     $ systemctl is-enabled rsyslog.service 
     enabled  
  
     $ systemctl is-active rsyslog.service 
     active  
  
If "rsyslog.service" is not enabled and active, this is a finding.

### Fix
Install the log service by using the following command:  
 
     $ sudo apt-get install rsyslog 
  
Enable and activate the log service by using the following command:  
  
     $ sudo systemctl enable rsyslog.service --now

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must monitor remote access methods.

### Description
Remote access services, such as those providing remote access to network devices and information systems, which lack automated monitoring capabilities, increase risk and make remote user access management difficult at best.  
  
Remote access is access to DOD nonpublic information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, nonorganization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.  
  
Automated monitoring of remote access sessions allows organizations to detect cyberattacks and also ensure ongoing compliance with remote access policies by auditing connection activities of remote access capabilities, such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), on a variety of information system components (e.g., servers, workstations, notebook computers, smartphones, and tablets).

### Rule Check
Verify that Ubuntu 22.04 LTS monitors all remote access methods by using the following command:  
  
     $  grep -Er '^(auth\.\*,authpriv\.\*|daemon\.\*)' /etc/rsyslog.* 
     /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf:auth.*,authpriv.* /var/log/secure 
     /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf:daemon.* /var/log/messages 
  
If "auth.*", "authpriv.*", or "daemon.*" are not configured to be logged in at least one of the config files, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to monitor all remote access methods. 
 
Add or modify the following line in the "/etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf" file: 
 
auth.*,authpriv.* /var/log/secure  
daemon.* /var/log/messages  
 
Restart "rsyslog.service" for the changes to take effect by using the following command:  
  
     $ sudo systemctl restart rsyslog.service

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must have the "auditd" package installed.

### Description
Without establishing the when, where, type, source, and outcome of events that occurred, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events leading up to an outage or attack.  
  
Without the capability to generate audit records, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.  
  
Audit record content that may be necessary to satisfy this requirement includes, for example, time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, filenames involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked.  
  
Reconstruction of harmful events or forensic analysis is not possible if audit records do not contain enough information.  
  
Successful incident response and auditing relies on timely, accurate system information and analysis in order to allow the organization to identify and respond to potential incidents in a proficient manner. If the operating system does not provide the ability to centrally review the operating system logs, forensic analysis is negatively impacted.  
  
Associating event types with detected events in Ubuntu 22.04 LTS audit logs provides a means of investigating an attack; recognizing resource utilization or capacity thresholds; or identifying an improperly configured operating system.

## V-260592

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS audit event multiplexor must be configured to offload audit logs onto a different system from the system being audited.

### Description
Information stored in one location is vulnerable to accidental or incidental deletion or alteration.  
  
Offloading is a common process in information systems with limited audit storage capacity. 
 
The auditd service does not include the ability to send audit records to a centralized server for management directly. However, it can use a plug-in for audit event multiplexor to pass audit records to a remote server.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000342-GPOS-00133, SRG-OS-000479-GPOS-00224

### Rule Check
Verify the audit event multiplexor is configured to offload audit records to a different system from the system being audited.  
  
Check if the "audispd-plugins" package is installed:  
  
     $ dpkg -l | grep audispd-plugins 
     ii     audispd-plugins     1:3.0.7-1build1     amd64     Plugins for the audit event dispatcher 
  
If the "audispd-plugins" package is not installed, this is a finding.  
  
Check that the records are being offloaded to a remote server by using the following command:  
  
     $ sudo grep -i active /etc/audit/plugins.d/au-remote.conf 
     active = yes  
  
If "active" is not set to "yes", or the line is commented out, or is missing, this is a finding.  
  
Check that audisp-remote plugin is configured to send audit logs to a different system:  
  
     $ sudo grep -i remote_server /etc/audit/audisp-remote.conf 
     remote_server = 240.9.19.81 
  
If the "remote_server" parameter is not set, is set with a local IP address, or is set with an invalid IP address, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure the audit event multiplexor to offload audit records to a different system from the system being audited.  
  
Install the "audisp-plugins" package by using the following command:  
  
     $ sudo apt-get install audispd-plugins

## V-260593

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must alert the information system security officer (ISSO) and system administrator (SA) in the event of an audit processing failure.

### Description
It is critical for the appropriate personnel to be aware if a system is at risk of failing to process audit logs as required. Without this notification, the security personnel may be unaware of an impending failure of the audit capability, and system operation may be adversely affected.  
  
Audit processing failures include software/hardware errors, failures in the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded.  
  
This requirement applies to each audit data storage repository (i.e., distinct information system component where audit records are stored), the centralized audit storage capacity of organizations (i.e., all audit data storage repositories combined), or both.

### Rule Check
Verify that the SA and ISSO are notified in the event of an audit processing failure by using the following command: 
 
Note: An email package must be installed on the system for email notifications to be sent. 
  
     $ sudo grep -i action_mail_acct /etc/audit/auditd.conf 
     action_mail_acct = <administrator_email_account> 
  
If "action_mail_acct" is not set to the email address of the SA and/or ISSO, is commented out, or is missing, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure "auditd" service to notify the SA and ISSO in the event of an audit processing failure.   
  
Add or modify the following line in the "/etc/audit/auditd.conf " file: 
  
action_mail_acct = <administrator_email_account>  
  
Note: Change "administrator_email_account" to the email address of the SA and/or ISSO. 
  
Restart the "auditd" service for the changes take effect:  
  
     $ sudo systemctl restart auditd.service

## V-260594

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must shut down by default upon audit failure.

### Description
It is critical that when the operating system is at risk of failing to process audit logs as required, it takes action to mitigate the failure. Audit processing failures include: software/hardware errors; failures in the audit capturing mechanisms; and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded. Responses to audit failure depend upon the nature of the failure mode.  
  
When availability is an overriding concern, other approved actions in response to an audit failure are as follows:   
  
1. If the failure was caused by the lack of audit record storage capacity, the operating system must continue generating audit records if possible (automatically restarting the audit service if necessary), overwriting the oldest audit records in a first-in-first-out manner.  
  
2. If audit records are sent to a centralized collection server and communication with this server is lost or the server fails, the operating system must queue audit records locally until communication is restored or until the audit records are retrieved manually. Upon restoration of the connection to the centralized collection server, action should be taken to synchronize the local audit data with the collection server.

### Rule Check
Verify Ubuntu 22.04 LTS takes the appropriate action when the audit storage volume is full by using the following command:  
  
     $ sudo grep -i disk_full_action /etc/audit/auditd.conf 
     disk_full_action = HALT 
  
If "disk_full_action" is not set to "HALT", "SYSLOG", or "SINGLE", is commented out, or is missing, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to shut down by default upon audit failure.  
  
Add or modify the following line in the "/etc/audit/auditd.conf " file: 
 
disk_full_action = HALT 
  
Restart the "auditd" service for the changes to take effect:  
  
     $ sudo systemctl restart auditd.service 
 
Note: If system availability has been determined to be more important, and this decision is documented with the ISSO, configure Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to notify system administration staff and ISSO staff in the event of an audit processing failure by setting the "disk_full_action" to "SYSLOG" or "SINGLE".

## V-260595

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must allocate audit record storage capacity to store at least one weeks' worth of audit records, when audit records are not immediately sent to a central audit record storage facility.

### Description
To ensure operating systems have a sufficient storage capacity in which to write the audit logs, operating systems must be able to allocate audit record storage capacity.  
  
The task of allocating audit record storage capacity is usually performed during initial installation of the operating system.

### Rule Check
Verify Ubuntu 22.04 LTS allocates audit record storage capacity to store at least one week's worth of audit records when audit records are not immediately sent to a central audit record storage facility.  
  
Determine which partition the audit records are being written to by using the following command:  
  
     $ sudo grep -i log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf 
     log_file = /var/log/audit/audit.log 
  
Check the size of the partition that audit records are written to (with the example being "/var/log/audit/") by using the following command:  
  
     $ sudo df -h /var/log/audit/ 
     /dev/sda2 24G 10.4G 13.6G 43% /var/log/audit 
  
If the audit records are not written to a partition made specifically for audit records ("/var/log/audit" as a separate partition), determine the amount of space being used by other files in the partition by using the following command:  
  
     $ sudo du -sh <audit_partition> 
     1.8G /var/log/audit  
  
Note: The partition size needed to capture a week's worth of audit records is based on the activity level of the system and the total storage capacity available.  
  
If the audit record partition is not allocated for sufficient storage capacity, this is a finding.

### Fix
Allocate enough storage capacity for at least one week's worth of audit records when audit records are not immediately sent to a central audit record storage facility.  
  
If audit records are stored on a partition made specifically for audit records, use the "parted" program to resize the partition with sufficient space to contain one week's worth of audit records.  
  
If audit records are not stored on a partition made specifically for audit records, a new partition with sufficient amount of space will need be to be created.  
  
Set the auditd server to point to the mount point where the audit records must be located:  
  
     $ sudo sed -i -E 's@^(log_file\s*=\s*).*@\1 <audit_partition_mountpoint>/audit.log@' /etc/audit/auditd.conf  
  
where <audit_partition_mountpoint> is the aforementioned mount point.

## V-260596

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must immediately notify the system administrator (SA) and information system security officer (ISSO) when the audit record storage volume reaches 25 percent remaining of the allocated capacity.

### Description
If security personnel are not notified immediately when storage volume reaches 25 percent remaining of the allocated capacity, they are unable to plan for audit record storage capacity expansion.

### Rule Check
Verify Ubuntu 22.04 LTS is configured to notify the SA and ISSO when the audit record storage volume reaches 25 percent remaining of the allocated capacity by using the following command:  
 
     $ sudo grep -i space_left /etc/audit/auditd.conf 
     space_left = 25% 
     space_left_action = email 
  
If "space_left" is set to a value less than "25%", is commented out, or is missing, this is a finding.

If "space_left_action" is not set to "email", is commented out, or is missing, this is a finding. 
  
Note: If the "space_left_action" is set to "exec", the system executes a designated script. If this script informs the SA of the event, this is not a finding.

### Fix
Configure Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to notify the SA and ISSO when the audit record storage volume reaches 25 percent remaining of the allocated capacity. 
 
Add or modify the following lines in the "/etc/audit/auditd.conf " file: 
 
space_left = 25% 
space_left_action = email 
 
Restart the "auditd" service for the changes to take effect:  
  
     $ sudo systemctl restart auditd.service 
  
Note: If the "space_left_action" parameter is set to "exec", ensure the command being executed notifies the SA and ISSO.

## V-260600

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must be configured so that the audit log directory is not write-accessible by unauthorized users.

### Description
If audit information were to become compromised, then forensic analysis and discovery of the true source of potentially malicious system activity is impossible to achieve.  
  
To ensure the veracity of audit information, the operating system must protect audit information from unauthorized deletion. This requirement can be achieved through multiple methods, which will depend upon system architecture and design.  
  
Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings, audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system activity.

### Rule Check

Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must generate audit records for successful/unsuccessful uses of the ssh-keysign command.

### Description
Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.  
  
Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).

### Rule Check
Verify Ubuntu 22.04 LTS generates an audit record upon successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the "ssh-keysign" command by using the following command: 
  
     $ sudo auditctl -l | grep ssh-keysign 
     -a always,exit -S all -F path=/usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=-1 -F key=privileged-ssh  
  
If the command does not return lines that match the example or the lines are commented out, this is a finding.  
  
Note: The "key=" value is arbitrary and can be different from the example output above.

### Fix
Configure the audit system to generate an audit event for any successful/unsuccessful use of the "ssh-keysign" command.   
  
Add or modify the following line in the "/etc/audit/rules.d/stig.rules" file:

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must generate audit records for successful/unsuccessful uses of the chmod, fchmod, and fchmodat system calls.

### Description
Without generating audit records specific to the security and mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.  
  
Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter). 
 
The system call rules are loaded into a matching engine that intercepts each syscall that all programs on the system makes. Therefore, it is very important to only use syscall rules when absolutely necessary since these affect performance. The more rules, the bigger the performance hit. The performance is helped, though, by combining syscalls into one rule whenever possible.

Without generating audit records specific to the security and mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.  
  
Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter). 
 
The system call rules are loaded into a matching engine that intercepts each syscall that all programs on the system makes. Therefore, it is very important to only use syscall rules when absolutely necessary since these affect performance. The more rules, the bigger the performance hit. The performance is helped, though, by combining syscalls into one rule whenever possible.

### Rule Check
Verify Ubuntu 22.04 LTS generates an audit record upon unsuccessful attempts to use the "creat", "open", "openat", "open_by_handle_at", "truncate", and "ftruncate" system calls by using the following command:  
  
     $ sudo auditctl -l | grep 'open\|truncate\|creat'  
     -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S creat,open,openat,open_by_handle_at,truncate,ftruncate -F exit=-EPERM -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=-1 -F key=perm_access  
     -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S creat,open,openat,open_by_handle_at,truncate,ftruncate -F exit=-EACCES -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=-1 -F key=perm_access  
     -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S creat,open,openat,open_by_handle_at,truncate,ftruncate -F exit=-EPERM -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=-1 -F key=perm_access

If the command does not return audit rules for the "creat", "open", "openat", "open_by_handle_at", "truncate", and "ftruncate" syscalls or the lines are commented out, this is a finding.  
  
Note: The "key=" value is arbitrary and can be different from the example output above.

### Fix
Configure the audit system to generate an audit event for any unsuccessful use of the "creat", "open", "openat", "open_by_handle_at", "truncate", and "ftruncate" system calls.   
  
Add or modify the following lines in the "/etc/audit/rules.d/stig.rules" file:  
  
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S creat,open,openat,open_by_handle_at,truncate,ftruncate -F exit=-EPERM -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k perm_access  
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S creat,open,openat,open_by_handle_at,truncate,ftruncate -F exit=-EACCES -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k perm_access  
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S creat,open,openat,open_by_handle_at,truncate,ftruncate -F exit=-EPERM -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k perm_access  
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S creat,open,openat,open_by_handle_at,truncate,ftruncate -F exit=-EACCES -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k perm_access  
  
To reload the rules file, issue the following command:  
  
     $ sudo augenrules --load 
 
Note: The "-k <keyname>" at the end of the line gives the rule a unique meaning to help during an audit investigation. The <keyname> does not need to match the example above.

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must generate audit records for all events that affect the systemd journal files.

### Description
Once an attacker establishes access to a system, the attacker often attempts to create a persistent method of reestablishing access. One way to accomplish this is for the attacker to modify system level binaries and their operation. Auditing the systemd journal files provides logging that can be used for forensic purposes. 
  
To address access requirements, many operating systems may be integrated with enterprise level authentication/access/auditing mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements.

Verify Ubuntu 22.04 LTS audits the execution of privilege functions by auditing the "execve" system call by using the following command:  
  
     $ sudo auditctl -l | grep execve 
     -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -C uid!=euid -F euid=0 -F key=execpriv 
     -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -C gid!=egid -F egid=0 -F key=execpriv 
     -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S execve -C uid!=euid -F euid=0 -F key=execpriv 
     -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S execve -C gid!=egid -F egid=0 -F key=execpriv 
  
If the command does not return lines that match the example or the lines are commented out, this is a finding.  
  
Note: The "key=" value is arbitrary and can be different from the example output above.

### Fix
Configure Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to audit the execution of all privileged functions.  
  
Add or modify the following lines in the "/etc/audit/rules.d/stig.rules" file:  
  
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -C uid!=euid -F euid=0 -k execpriv 
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -C gid!=egid -F egid=0 -k execpriv 
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S execve -C uid!=euid -F euid=0 -k execpriv 
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S execve -C gid!=egid -F egid=0 -k execpriv 
 
To reload the rules file, issue the following command:  
  
     $ sudo augenrules --load 
 
Note: The "-k <keyname>" at the end of the line gives the rule a unique meaning to help during an audit investigation. The <keyname> does not need to match the example above.

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must generate audit records for privileged activities, nonlocal maintenance, diagnostic sessions and other system-level access.

### Description
If events associated with nonlocal administrative access or diagnostic sessions are not logged, a major tool for assessing and investigating attacks would not be available.  
  
This requirement addresses auditing-related issues associated with maintenance tools used specifically for diagnostic and repair actions on organizational information systems.  
  
Nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities conducted by individuals communicating through a network, either an external network (e.g., the internet) or an internal network. Local maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities carried out by individuals physically present at the information system or information system component and not communicating across a network connection.  
  
This requirement applies to hardware/software diagnostic test equipment or tools. This requirement does not cover hardware/software components that may support information system maintenance, yet are a part of the system, for example, the software implementing "ping," "ls," "ipconfig," or the hardware and software implementing the monitoring port of an Ethernet switch.

### Rule Check
Verify Ubuntu 22.04 LTS audits activities performed during nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions by using the following command:  
  
     $ sudo auditctl -l | grep sudo.log  
     -w /var/log/sudo.log -p wa -k maintenance  
  
If the command does not return lines that match the example or the lines are commented out, this is a finding.  
  
Note: The "-k" value is arbitrary and can be different from the example output above.

### Fix
Configure Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to audit activities performed during nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions.  
  
Add or modify the following line in the "/etc/audit/rules.d/stig.rules" file:  
  
-w /var/log/sudo.log -p wa -k maintenance

## V-260650

### Title
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must implement NIST FIPS-validated cryptography to protect classified information and for the following: To provision digital signatures, to generate cryptographic hashes, and to protect unclassified information requiring confidentiality and cryptographic protection in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards.

### Description
Use of weak or untested encryption algorithms undermines the purposes of utilizing encryption to protect data. The operating system must implement cryptographic modules adhering to the higher standards approved by the federal government since this provides assurance they have been tested and validated.

### Rule Check
Verify the system is configured to run in FIPS mode by using the following command:  
  
     $ grep -i 1 /proc/sys/crypto/fips_enabled 
     1  
  
If a value of "1" is not returned, this is a finding.

### Fix
Configure Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to run in FIPS mode. Add "fips=1" to the kernel parameter during Ubuntu 22.04 LTS install.  
  
Enabling a FIPS mode on a pre-existing system involves a number of modifications to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. Refer to the Ubuntu Pro security certification documentation for instructions.   
  
A subscription to the "Ubuntu Pro" plan is required to obtain the FIPS Kernel cryptographic modules and enable FIPS. 
 
Note: Ubuntu Pro security certification instructions can be found at: https://ubuntu.com/security/certifications/docs/fips-enablement
