# Ubuntu-22-04-Meta-STIG-Markdown
Simple, stripped down markdown for Meta STIG rules for Ubuntu 22.04. No need to run the STIG viewer, these rules have been converted from the official STIG rules XML from the Department of Defense website. Also included is the Python script used to convert the XML into markdown, it should presumably work with any similarly formatted XML database.
